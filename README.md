The entire code is in a single file. Intermediary/final results are printed and visualized after each block of code.
We proceed with the instalation with some necessary libraries
The next block performs loading and normalization of the data; ai it is quite long process (about 5 min), We introduced a tool to visualize the time left to compute
Then we make computations and visualizations for our data (vocabvulary size, data size, number of instances per laberl/class)
The next block contains the code for vectorization, data split and implementation for Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models
The following block is for visualizations of these models
At the end there is a cell containing code for creating a table with the results obtained
